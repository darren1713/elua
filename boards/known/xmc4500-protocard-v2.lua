-- Infineon XMC4500 prototype card v2 build configuration

--[[

Notes:

1) This particular target doesn't have any on-board peripherals. The
   board can be used to talk to the Maxon BLDC interface. OR toggle a
   few LEDS from eLua. OR play terminal games.

2) No SDMMC. That makes me sad! :(

3) The fun part about this particular board is that it is very tiny. I
   like to call it "pocket eLua" in the context of this target.
