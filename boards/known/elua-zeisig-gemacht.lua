Zeisig Labortechnik: eLua board file for the cryogenic machine's
processor board

Notes:

1) This machine controls the internal temperature of specifically
designed viscometry baths with a stability of +/- 0.01 degree C. As
much as I love to see the measurements of a viscometer (usually, the
computation of Billmeyer viscosity of ploymers dissolved in Formic
acid), I personally also love to see eLua on every target platform I
work with. What is fun without SpaceShip OR Game of life?
